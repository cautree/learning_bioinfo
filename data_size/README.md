A typical 10 million pair of Illumina reads would be around 3-4 GB of data, assuming a standard read length of 150 base pairs per read. 
Explanation:
Calculation: 10 million pairs of reads = 20 million reads.
Read length: 150 base pairs per read (typical for Illumina). 
Conversion to GB: 20 million reads * 150 base pairs/read * (1 GB / 1 billion base pairs) = ~3 GB.
